"""Focused tests for LLMAdapter's background-task dispatch behavior.

These verify that `submit_llm_votes` / `submit_llm_night_actions` are
fire-and-forget: the caller returns immediately even if the underlying
decider is slow, and in-flight tasks abort cleanly when the game's phase
advances or ends mid-iteration.

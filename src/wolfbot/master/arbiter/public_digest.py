"""Master-side public-info digest builder.

Phase-D: Master is responsible for structuring the public log into
something each NPC bot can fold into its prompt without re-doing the
NLP. This module turns the live `PublicDiscussionState` + recent
`SpeechEvent` rows into a compact, *role-blind* Japanese block. Each
NPC bot receives the same digest regardless of role; their own private
state is what differentiates the eventual decision.

What lands in the digest:

* Active CO claims: seat → role, with counter-CO history.
* Silent seats (alive seats who haven't spoken in the day's discussion).
* Last addressed line: the most recent seat-to-seat callout text so the
  NPC can reply on-topic.
* Recent speeches (last N): full text per utterance so the vote / night
  decision LLM sees what the seer / medium actually claimed. Without
  this the vote prompt only saw 「席9 が seer CO」 and 「席3 が medium
  CO」 — no SQ-黒 detail — and ラキオ ended up voting セツ instead of
  the SQ that ユリコ called black.
* Past votes from completed days: voter → target ledger so the LLM can
  reason about who voted whom historically.

Pure function of the inputs — no I/O, no LLM. Master invokes it once
per outbound `DecideVoteRequest` / `DecideNightActionRequest` /
`SpeakRequest` and stuffs the result into `public_state_summary`.
